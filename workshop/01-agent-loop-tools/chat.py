"""Interactive multi-turn chat for Module 1: Agent Loop + Tools.

The notebook runs the agent one prompt at a time (each cell is one turn). This
script wraps the same agent in a loop so you can hold a real multi-turn
conversation in the terminal - the agent keeps its context across turns.

From the cloned repo root:

    cd samples/01-agent-loop-tools
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python chat.py

Type 'quit', 'exit', or press Ctrl+C to stop.

Be helpful, professional, and concise. Use the available tools to look up customer

- Always verify the customer using lookup_customer before taking action.
- Use tool data to answer questions - don't ask the customer for info you already have.
- Be warm but efficient."""
