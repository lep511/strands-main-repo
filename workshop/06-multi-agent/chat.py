"""Interactive multi-turn chat for Module 6: Multi-Agent (Optional).

The notebook runs the orchestrator one prompt at a time (each cell is one turn).
This script wraps the same orchestrator - which delegates technical issues to a
tech support specialist via the agents-as-tools pattern - in a loop so you can
hold a real multi-turn conversation in the terminal.

From the cloned repo root:

    cd samples/06-multi-agent
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python chat.py

Type 'quit', 'exit', or press Ctrl+C to stop.
